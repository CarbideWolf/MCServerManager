MCServerManager
===============

A simple console application to help with managing minecraft servers (vanilla and modded).

Features:
- Start the server (with RAM and Permgen arguments)
- Run a backup every hour (save-all server command and file copy)
- Send text written into console window to server as commands

If you don't like console applications I have a version 2.0 with a GUI here: https://github.com/CarbideWolf/MCServerManager-v2.0
